## Layout

```

  SKILL.md        # the skill itself (YAML frontmatter + instructions)
  skill.json      # version, provenance, verification record
  CHANGELOG.md    # SemVer history for the skill
  NOTICE.md       # upstream attribution and license
  references/     # progressive-disclosure docs

```

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarnessYoung/personal-skills.git
cp -R personal-skills/skills/cnsplots ~/.codex/skills/cnsplots
cp -R personal-skills/skills/python-script-conventions ~/.codex/skills/python-script-conventions
```

Claude Code uses `~/.claude/skills/` instead. Verify a skill's environment:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/cnsplots/scripts/check_env.py
```

## Versioning

Each skill carries its **own** SemVer version in `skill.json`, independent of the
upstream tool it wraps:

- **major** — breaking workflow change; agents must relearn the flow
- **minor** — new capability, script, or reference doc
- **patch** — clarification or fix with no behavioral change

Every skill records `verification.verified_against_package_version`. When the
wrapped tool releases a new version, re-run the bundled checks and bump that
field with a changelog entry.

## Provenance policy

Every skill declares one `origin`:

- `original` — written from scratch here
- `derivative-enhancement` — based on an upstream skill, with upstream repo,
  license, and a file-level breakdown in `NOTICE.md`
- `vendored` — copied essentially unchanged

Derived skills keep their upstream license and credit the original author.

## License

BSD-3-Clause. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). Derived skills additionally carry upstream
terms; see each skill's `NOTICE.md`.
